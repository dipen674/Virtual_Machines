# In this example i am practicing handlers


In this example i have practiced about roles in ansible.
The main file to trigger role is playbook.yaml

I have created different files based on the task they are doing.

In this file i have merged all the examples that i have practiced above and trigerred them with the help of role.

Using role all the files are managed properly
WHat i have done here

#Created separated files to do separate tasks

#called the different tasks from a single file in tasks direectory.

#Mentioned only host name in playbook.yaml file.

#Arranged tasks in tasks directory

#templates in templates directory

   #.j2 extension is compulsory

#variables in vars directory

   #You can also add variables in defaults

#handlers tasks in handlers main.yml file
